EDIT Distance based tool for various NLP tasks

This software is a new tool based on Edit Distance Textual Entailment Suite - EDITS. The original version of EDTS can still be found on the SourceForge svn (http://sourceforge.net/p/edits/code/HEAD/tree/). The version 2.1 of EDITS is integrated in the system developed by the Excitement project (http://www.excitement-project.eu/).

The aim software is to implement algorithms for recognizing relations between two text fragments based on edit distance and various other algorithms.
